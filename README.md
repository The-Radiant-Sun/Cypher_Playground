The three files named 'Front', 'GUI', and 'Cyphers' are required to download, and the code within 'Front' initiates the application when run.
All cyphers should be placed within the 'Codes' folder, and if there are others added that are not within the main package, maintain the 'encrypt', 'decrypt' and 'history' functions like the official codes.

There will be instructions within each file and within the GUI explaining what everything does, and how to use the application.

Thank you for using this application.
